<h2>Stalingrad VR</h2>
<h3>Objectives</h3>
<p>My objectives for this assignment were to create a VR world of the war of Stalingrad, and to make it able to inform other students on what actually happened during that battle. I would say these were completed, and it looks rather nice.</p>
<h3>How I Did It</h3>
<p>I took models off of SketchFab to put into the world that were involved with the battle, which were mostly weapons and armours used in the battle itself. My partner in the assignment made all the facts about the fight.</p>
<h3>Problems</h3>
<p>I came across a few problems, where I could not find good models, and it was hard to get the historical accuracy correct, but they were all fixed with time and patience.</p>
