<h2>Bulletkin 3D Models</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>I made two different projects due to the fact that I had enough time. They were both based on irl models of bullets and from the enemies of the game Enter The Gungeon. The two projects in question are a normal bullet and a shotgun shell. The bullet is good with shading, but could have had a better face and could be a little longer. The shell has the same pros as the bullet, but the face is even worse and the proportions are kind of off, while the detailing on the top and bottom is better. If I had more time I would have redone the basic models and maybe imported it over to Autodesk, as although I have no experience with it, it might be better than Sculptris.</p>
<h3>Objectives</h3>
<p>My objectives were to make a 3D model of a Bulletkin, but I finished that far faster than I thought, and ended up making the second one as well. I think that I succeeded in making a good 3D model.</p>
<h3>How I Did It</h3>
<p>I used Sculptris to make the bodies completely from scratch, and I also used it to paint them. </p>
<h3>Problems</h3>
<p>I came across a few problems, such as my models not turning out right and accidentally making mistakes of many kinds with the paint, but once I figured out how to shade with white and black on really low settings, it all worked out.</p>
